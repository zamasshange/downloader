## 💻 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

**All Platforms:**
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

**Platform-Specific:**
- **Windows:** NSIS (for installer builds)
- **macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools
- **Linux:** build-essential, libfuse2

### Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zamasshange/downloader.git
cd downloader

# Wire the pre-commit and pre-push hooks (one-time per clone)
# Runs version sync + parity check + full test suite before every commit and push
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# Install Python dependencies (shared)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Linux development (uses separate requirements)
pip install -r linux/requirements.txt
```

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### Windows

```bash
# No additional setup needed
# Runtime dependencies download automatically on first launch
```

#### macOS

```bash
cd mac
chmod +x BUILD.sh
# See mac/BUILD_NOTES.txt for detailed build instructions
```

#### Linux

```bash
cd linux
chmod +x BUILD.sh
# See linux/INSTRUCTIONS.txt for build requirements
```

---

## 🔨 Build System

We use a unified version management system. **Never manually edit version numbers!**

### Standard Build Workflow

```bash
# 1. Bump build number (required before EVERY build)
python scripts/bump-version.py

# 2. Add patch notes
python scripts/add-patchnote.py "Your change 1" "Your change 2"

# 3. Build your platform
# Windows: Use your build process
# Mac: bash mac/BUILD.sh
# Linux: bash linux/BUILD.sh

# 4. Generate update JSONs
python scripts/gen-update-json.py --notes "Your change 1; Your change 2"
```

### Version Bumping

```bash
# Increment build number only (most common)
python scripts/bump-version.py

# Increment version string (e.g., v0.98 → v0.99)
python scripts/bump-version.py --version 0.99

# Preview changes without writing
python scripts/bump-version.py --dry-run
```

### Utility Scripts

All scripts are in `scripts/` directory:

- **bump-version.py** - Increment build/version, sync all files
- **add-patchnote.py** - Add entries to patchnotes.txt
- **gen-update-json.py** - Generate platform update JSONs

Run any script with `--help` for detailed usage.

## 📝 Coding Guidelines

### Python (Backend)

- **Style:** PEP 8 compliant
- **Line length:** 100 characters max
- **Docstrings:** All public functions
- **Type hints:** Preferred but not required
- **Imports:** Grouped (stdlib, third-party, local)

**Example:**
```python
def sanitize_filename(name: str, ext: str = "") -> str:
    """
    Remove unsafe characters from filename.
    
    Args:
        name: Raw filename
        ext: File extension (with or without dot)
        
    Returns:
        Sanitized filename with extension
    """
    safe = re.sub(r'[<>:"/\\|?*]', '', name)
    return f"{safe}{ext}" if safe else f"download{ext}"
```

### JavaScript (Frontend)

- **Style:** Standard.js conventions
- **Semicolons:** Consistent usage
- **Quotes:** Single quotes for strings
- **Functions:** Arrow functions for callbacks
- **Comments:** Explain complex logic

**Example:**
```javascript
// Fetch available formats for URL
async function fetchFormats(url) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/formats', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ url })
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): brief description

Longer description if needed

Examples:
  fix(windows): resolve installer crash on Windows 11
  feat(ui): add dark mode toggle
  docs(readme): update build instructions
  refactor(backend): simplify format parsing logic
```

**Types:**
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `feat` - New features
- `docs` - Documentation
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Testing
- `chore` - Maintenance

### Shared vs Platform-Specific

**Shared (Windows + Mac):**
- `app.py` - Main backend
- `templates/index.html` - UI
- `static/` - Assets
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

**Linux-Specific:**
- `linux/app.py` - Linux-specific backend, AppImage paths
- `linux/templates/` - Slightly different UI
- `linux/requirements.txt` - Linux-specific dependencies

> **Why does Linux have its own `app.py` and `templates/`?** The AppImage distribution model requires self-contained runtime bootstrapping (downloading Node.js, Electron, and ffmpeg on first launch) and different path resolution. These constraints make a shared backend impractical, so Linux maintains its own copy with platform-specific adaptations.

**Platform Directories:**
- `windows/electron/` - Windows Electron configuration
- `mac/electron/` - Mac Electron configuration
- `linux/electron/` - Linux Electron configuration

### Key Files

- **version.json** - Master version/build record (NEVER edit manually)
- **patchnotes.txt** - User-facing changelog
- **LICENSE** - AGPL-3.0 License

## 🔒 CI Policy — SHA-Pinned Actions

All GitHub Actions in this repo are pinned to specific commit SHAs (not version tags) to protect against supply chain attacks. When adding new actions or updating existing ones, pin to the commit SHA and keep the version as a trailing comment:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@93cb6efe18208431cddfb8368fd83d5badbf9bfd  # v5
```

Dependabot is configured to open weekly PRs proposing updated SHA pins when actions release new versions. Review the PR, verify the new SHA points to a legitimate release, then merge.
