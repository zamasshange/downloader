"""Tooltip/attribute translation coverage guard.

Found by EGM during manual testing: roughly half of the app's tooltips
(title=/aria-label=/placeholder=/alt=) were hardcoded English with zero
i18n wiring of any kind, regardless of selected language. History window
had ZERO wired tooltips. The translation *mechanism* itself was never
broken (verified independently with a real browser render before writing
this test) -- these attributes just never got wired in the first place.

Root cause: tooltip translation happened incrementally, tied to whatever
feature was being built that day, never as one deliberate sweep of every
existing tooltip already in the app. The only prior i18n test
(test_i18n_keys_exist_in_en_locale) checks the opposite direction --
that keys someone already referenced actually exist -- it has no
awareness of an attribute that was never referenced at all.

This test flags any title/placeholder/aria-label/alt attribute that
looks like real, static, translatable UI copy but has no i18n wiring of
either recognized kind:
  - the static convention: data-i18n-attr="attr:key" on the same element
  - the dynamic convention (JS-template-literal windows): an inline
    i18nAttr()/i18nGet()/i18nFmt() call inside the attribute's own value

Two classes of match are correctly NOT flagged, both confirmed by
tracing real examples before writing the exclusion, not guessed:
  - CSS attribute selectors inside <style> blocks (e.g. history.html's
    .rb[title="Re-add"] -- matches an element by its title value, isn't
    an element's title attribute itself)
  - attributes that are purely user data after removing ${...}
    interpolation (channel names, file paths via attrEsc()) -- these
    display the user's own data, not app copy, and must never be
    translated (same principle as never translating a person's name)

New static tooltips going forward: use data-i18n-attr like everything
else. New dynamic ones (template-literal windows): call i18nAttr()
inline, same as the existing wired examples in those files.

Scope is derived from the template tree (templates/*.html +
templates/js/*.html), not a hand-maintained list -- the original
hardcoded 4-window list missed the 8 JS partials, which held 3 live
unwired tooltips (found by running this same detector over them). A new
window or partial added later is covered automatically; the
scope-sanity test below keeps the glob honest (a glob that silently
matches nothing would pass vacuously). Files that are pure CSS/data
(index_styles, theme_styles, theme_data) contribute no attribute
matches and cost nothing to scan.
