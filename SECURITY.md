# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The EGM Downloader team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

**Scope:** This policy applies to the official EGM Downloader application and its official distribution channels (egerena.com and this GitHub repository). Third-party forks or unofficial distributions are not covered.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report security concerns through one of these methods:

#### Option 1: Email (Preferred)
Send details to: **contact@egerena.com**

#### Option 2: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting
Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/zamasshange/downloader/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description** - Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce** - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact** - What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Affected Versions** - Which versions are vulnerable?
- **Suggested Fix** - (Optional) If you have ideas for a fix
- **Your Contact** - How we can reach you for follow-up

### Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Potential XSS vulnerability in filename display

Description:
User-supplied filenames are displayed in the UI without proper sanitization,
potentially allowing XSS attacks through malicious filenames.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a file with filename: <script>alert('xss')</script>.mp4
2. Observe the filename displayed in the download list
3. Script executes in the context of the application

Impact:
An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when downloaded, executes
arbitrary JavaScript in the application context.

Affected Versions:
v0.91 Build 92 and earlier

Suggested Fix:
Sanitize filenames using DOMPurify or similar before displaying in UI.
```

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment** - Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Initial Assessment** - Within 1 week of acknowledgment
- **Status Updates** - Every 2 weeks until resolution
- **Fix Development** - Depends on severity (critical issues prioritized)
- **Disclosure** - Coordinated with reporter after fix is released

## Security Update Process

When a security vulnerability is confirmed:

1. **Private Fix** - We develop a fix in a private branch
2. **Testing** - Thorough testing to ensure fix works and doesn't break functionality
3. **Release** - Emergency release with security patch
4. **Disclosure** - Public disclosure after users have time to update (typically 7-14 days)
5. **Credit** - Reporter credited in release notes (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest  | ✅ Yes    |
| < Latest | ❌ No — please update to the latest version |

We provide security updates for the latest stable release only. Users on older versions should upgrade to the latest version available at https://egerena.com or https://github.com/zamasshange/downloader/releases.

## Security Best Practices for Users

### General Recommendations

- ✅ **Download from official sources only** - https://egerena.com or https://github.com/zamasshange/downloader
- ✅ **Keep software updated** - Enable auto-updates (Windows/Mac) or check regularly (Linux)
- ✅ **Verify checksums** - When available, verify file integrity
- ✅ **Use antivirus software** - Keep your system protected
- ✅ **Review permissions** - Understand what access the application requests

### What EGM Downloader Does NOT Do

- ❌ We never ask for passwords (except your own ZIP password if you set one)
- ❌ We never collect personal information
- ❌ We never send your download history to any server
- ❌ We never execute arbitrary code from downloaded videos
- ❌ We never access files outside the download directory

### Red Flags (Potential Scams)

If you encounter any of the following, you may have downloaded a fake or compromised version:

- 🚫 Requests for credit card information
- 🚫 Asks for admin/root password on every launch
- 🚫 Shows unexpected ads or pop-ups
- 🚫 Tries to install additional software without permission
- 🚫 Requests access to your email or social media accounts
- 🚫 Has a different icon or branding than shown on official site

**If you see any of these, DO NOT USE and report to contact@egerena.com**

## Known Security Considerations

### Third-Party Dependencies

EGM Downloader relies on several third-party components:

- **yt-dlp** - Download engine (updated via plugin system)
- **FFmpeg** - Media processing (updated via plugin system)
- **Electron** - Desktop framework (updated with app releases)

We monitor security advisories for these dependencies and release updates promptly when vulnerabilities are discovered.

### Network Activity

EGM Downloader makes network requests to:

- **Video hosting sites** - To download requested content
- **egerena.com** - To check for updates (Windows/Mac only)
- **Package managers** - To download yt-dlp and FFmpeg updates
- **Video thumbnail CDNs** - To cache thumbnails for the download history view (HTTPS-only, 500 KB cap per image)

All network activity is related to core functionality. We do not send telemetry or analytics.

#### Thumbnail Fetching — Design Decision

Thumbnail URLs come from yt-dlp metadata and point to arbitrary content delivery networks (YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, etc.) — no fixed allowlist is feasible because the set of video platforms is open-ended. We deliberately allow these unrestricted hosts, with the following safeguards:

- **HTTPS-only**: `http://`, `file://`, `ftp://`, and other schemes are rejected at the fetch boundary
- **Size cap**: 500 KB hard limit on any thumbnail download (prevents abuse via large files)
- **Storage safety**: filenames are derived from `uuid.uuid4()` with whitelist-selected extensions (`.jpg`/`.png`/`.webp`); no path-traversal is possible at write time
- **Serve-side validation**: the `/api/thumbnail/<filename>` endpoint enforces a strict regex (`^[a-f0-9\-]+\.(jpg|png|webp)$`) and serves only files that exist in the thumbnails directory

This is the same threat-model decision other download-manager apps make (e.g., Downie) when handling arbitrary video sources.

### File System Access

The application:

- ✅ Reads/writes to the download directory you specify
- ✅ Reads/writes configuration in app data directory
- ✅ Reads/writes temporary files during processing

It does NOT:

- ❌ Access files outside designated directories
- ❌ Modify system files
- ❌ Install drivers or kernel modules
- ❌ Access webcam, microphone, or location

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow **coordinated disclosure** (also known as responsible disclosure):

1. Reporter privately notifies us
2. We confirm and develop a fix
3. We release the fix
4. We publicly disclose the vulnerability after users have time to update
5. We credit the reporter (unless they prefer anonymity)

We ask that reporters:

- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure (typically 90 days)
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what's needed to demonstrate it
- Do not access or modify other users' data
- Act in good faith

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently **do not** have a formal bug bounty program. However:

- We deeply appreciate security researchers' efforts
- We credit reporters in release notes and CREDITS.md
- We may offer rewards on a case-by-case basis for critical vulnerabilities

## Security Acknowledgments

We'd like to thank the following individuals for responsibly disclosing security issues:

## Platform Security Posture

EGM Downloader runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Each platform has slightly different security characteristics worth knowing about.

### Windows + macOS — Full sandbox

The Electron renderer process runs in an OS-level sandbox. If a renderer process is compromised (e.g., via a Chromium vulnerability), the sandbox prevents the compromised process from reading arbitrary files, writing arbitrary files, or making arbitrary network connections.

### Linux — Limited sandbox (AppImage limitation)

The Linux build ships as an AppImage. AppImage cannot set SUID on the `chrome-sandbox` helper binary, so the OS-level sandbox layer is disabled (`--no-sandbox` flag is set at startup). Other security layers remain active:

- Navigation handlers prevent in-window navigation to external URLs
- Content-Security-Policy enforced via Electron session
- Token authentication on all API calls
- Checksum verification on all downloaded binaries

We're tracking this gap. Two paths forward:
- Ship `.deb` / Flatpak alongside AppImage (sandbox works in both) — not yet scheduled; revisit when Linux usage volume justifies the added packaging and maintenance work
- Continue documenting honestly until then
